## 💭 Development Philosophy

> "Code is not just about making things work — it's about making things work **beautifully, efficiently, and sustainably**."

**I believe in:**
- **Quality over quantity** — Every line of code serves a purpose
- **User experience first** — Technology serves people, not algorithms
- **Continuous improvement** — There's always a better way to solve problems
- **Documentation matters** — Undocumented code is unmaintainable code
- **AI as a tool** — Augmenting human capabilities, not replacing creativity
